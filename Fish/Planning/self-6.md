## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 6

Indicate below where your TAs can find the following elements in your strategy and/or player-interface modules:

The implementation of the "steady state" phase of a board game
typically calls for several different pieces: playing a *complete
game*, the *start up* phase, playing one *round* of the game, playing a *turn*, 
each with different demands. The design recipe from the prerequisite courses call
for at least three pieces of functionality implemented as separate
functions or methods:

- the functionality for "place all penguins"

- a unit test for the "place all penguins" funtionality 

- the "loop till final game state"  function

- this function must initialize the game tree for the players that survived the start-up phase


- a unit test for the "loop till final game state"  function


- the "one-round loop" function


- a unit test for the "one-round loop" function


- the "one-turn" per player function


- a unit test for the "one-turn per player" function with a well-behaved player 


- a unit test for the "one-turn" function with a cheating player


- a unit test for the "one-turn" function with an failing player 


- for documenting which abnormal conditions the referee addresses 


- the place where the referee re-initializes the game tree when a player is kicked out for cheating and/or failing
