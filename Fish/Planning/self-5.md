## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 5

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin placements for setups 

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths 
  
- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules
