## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General 

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics 


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI 
    players and the game system?

    Yes. In addition to addressing that players will program their own AI 
    players in the first paragraph of systems.pdf, we also detail the game 
    state component in the final paragraph that will hold the data of the
    game, making it the game system of the project.



  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games

    Yes. The third paragraph of system.pdf details our plans for
    a referee sub-system to handle the game logic and manage
    individual games.



  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components

    Yes. This need is addressed by the server and connection management
    system detailed in the second paragraph of system.pdf.



- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
    
    This is covered by the second milestone, which is detailed in the third
    paragraph of milestones.pdf and will allow for local AI players to play 
    individual games.




  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer 

    We do not have a milestone for running complete tournaments on a single
    computer. However, this would be a great addition following our second
    milestone (milestones.pdf, third paragraph) to allow for local AI players 
    to play individual games.




  - for running remote tournaments on a network

    We do not have a milestone for running remote tournaments on a network.
    However, this would be a great addition after our last milestone to run
    a full game on a network (milestones.pdf, final paragraph).




- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?

    Yes. Each paragraph in both of the documents introduces the topic
    that will be discussed in the first sentence and sticks to said
    topic throughout.



  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?

    Yes. Each sentence contributes to the thesis statement of the
    paragraph it belongs to. There are no run on sentences in either
    document. 



  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?

    Yes; we tried to reuse terminology as appropriate in order to keep
	continuity between sentences. This should ensure that readers are 
	able to keep reading without any difficulty.


  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?

    All sentences are complete. There are no missing verbs, objects, or
    other essential words. The only minimal concern in systems.pdf is an
    unnecessary comma in the first sentence of system.pdf ("...connections,
     and is...").



  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)

    Yes. All spelling in the documents was thoroughly checked, and we do
    not have any spelling mistakes to report.



The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices. 

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
